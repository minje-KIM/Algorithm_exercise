This repository is dedicated to preparing for coding tests by solving a variety of problem-solving questions and sharing the corresponding code solutions. All the code is written in C++.

The solved problems are categorized by difficulty levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold) and organized into individual problem folders. 

Each problem folder contains a README file with the problem description and a .cc file with my solution code.
